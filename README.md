# Real-Data-Analysis-for-Leukemia-and-Prostate-Cancer-


My name is Leen Madani and I am a student enrolled in the Master of Biotechnology program (Digital Health Technologies stream) at the University of Toronto.

My repositories contain projects that I worked on throughout my master's year. If the project is done with teams, then this will be clearly indicated.

The projects are primarily relevant to data science in health, where I attempt to answer a research question through a thorough analysis of a dataset. The process involves data cleaning and the usage of a lot of statistical techniques (regression models, survival analysis, machine learning, classification, etc..).

If you have any questions, please email me at leen.madani@mail.utoronto.ca



Solo Project (Real Data Analysis)

Apply linear and logistic regression to real data for two separate health applications to answer two questions.

Question 1 (Linear Regression) 

Utility scores constitute a single global preference-based measure of quality of life and they are essential for cost-effectiveness analyses. Utility scores range from 1 (perfect health) to 0 (dead), and often take values less than 0, indicating health states worse than “dead”. Utility scores can be obtained or calculated in different ways, one of them being by using a generic or disease-specific instrument (such as EQ5D or HUI). In some cases data from those types of questionnaire instruments are not available, while data from other kind of quality of life instruments (from which utilities cannot be calculated directly) are. It is of interest the building of a “map” between descriptive and “utility” instruments, so that utility scores can be estimated from the former whenever data from the latter are not available.

In this study the intention is to build a mapping linear regression model between the UCLA-PCI descriptive instrument that assesses the Health Related Quality of Life in Prostate Cancer patients, and the PORPUS utility instrument. Dataset used is study3.


Question 2 (Logistic regression) 

In this question you will apply logistic regression in order to predict the risk of developing acute graft-versus-disease in leukemia patients that received a type of bone marrow (nondepleted allogenic).
